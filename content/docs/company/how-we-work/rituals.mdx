## All staff monthly sprint

Every Monday of each month, we schedule a call where all team members are present. During this call, we review the past month, sync on who is working on what, and plan for the next month. This event can also be used to publicly discuss any other topics anyone has in mind and share them with others.

## Christmas meetup

We all meet in person at least once a year. Usually we have dinner together followed by other activities, either in our office or elsewhere, where we enjoy each other's company. Everything is on us, including accommodation.
