## Why coffee matters

Coffee isn’t a perk, it’s infrastructure. Our projects run on equal parts code and caffeine.

## The Rules of Coffee

- First coffee → then meetings
- Never disturb a teammate mid-first-sip
- Good coffee > bad coffee > no coffee
- Whoever makes the last coffee, fills up the machine first next time

## Coffee & Remote Work

- Show off your weird mug on calls
- always have coffee within arm’s reach
- never say no to a virtual coffee break
- every coffee is better with a friend (virtually or IRL)

## Manifesto

Great code starts after great coffee. At GTDN, coffee is our unofficial programming language.

Always remember: **more espresso, less depresso.**
