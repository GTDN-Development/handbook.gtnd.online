title: "Invoicing proccess - rewrite"
description: "Invoicing process: monthly time tracking, clear hourly rates, and consistent billing with 14-day payment terms."
---

## Timeline

- **1st day of each month (morning)** → close the previous month and issue invoices
- If the 1st is a weekend, invoicing happens on the **first working day**
- All invoices must be sent **within the first week of the month**

## Time Tracking

- Every hour worked must be logged → **unlogged time cannot be invoiced**
- Each team member is responsible for tracking their own hours accurately
- Hours are rounded **up to the nearest 15 minutes**

## Sending Invoices

- All teammate's invoices are sent to **sebek@gtdn.online**
- **Payment terms: 14 days**
- Each team member calculates their hours and sends the invoice during the first week of the month

## Rates

- **Senior positions** → 500 CZK / hour
- **Juniors / trainees** → lower hourly rate, based on current skill level

## Manifesto

Clear tracking, clear invoicing.  
No logged time, no invoice.  
Transparency and consistency keep the process fair for everyone.
