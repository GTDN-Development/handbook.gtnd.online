## Remote

Our workflow is 100% remote, but we have an office, where we can gather if needed.

## Async

We care about results, not when you work.

You can organize your day however you want. Most work doesn't require constant communication with others. But waiting hours for replies isn't efficient either, so we have a **communication window: 10:00–14:00 CET, Monday to Friday**. During this time, we expect you to be available for collaboration.

Of course there will be times you need real-time collaboration with someone or with a client, but this shouldn't be as often. We use messages, video calls, screen-sharing, and in-person meetings when async doesn't work.

## Self-management

You set your own goals and execute them. No daily check-ins or micromanagement.

Figure out what needs to be done, prioritize your work, and get it done. Take ownership of your projects and features from start to finish. If you need help, ask. Otherwise, we trust you to manage yourself.

## Flow state

**A flow state, or "being in the zone," is a mental state of complete absorption and energized focus in an activity, where you lose self-consciousness, time distortion occurs, and actions feel effortless and automatic.**

We believe great work happens when you're in flow state.

That's why we try to stay in flow without interruptions for as long as possible. Most meetings and communication should happen around lunch time. That way, you get two chunks of time (morning and afternoon) where you can get into the zone and stay there for a decent stretch (three hours or more, depending on your schedule).
