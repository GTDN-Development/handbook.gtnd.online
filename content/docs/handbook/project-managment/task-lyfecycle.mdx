title: "Task lifecycle"
description: "Task lifecycle — from idea to delivery. Clear steps, ownership, and efficient workflows that keep projects moving forward."

All tasks are created in [**ClickUp**](https://app.clickup.com/home), according to their type (e.g. Client / Internal).

## General Rules

- **Task name** → short, clear, and easy to understand
- **Description** → detailed enough so anyone in the team can understand the context
- **Attachments** → large files go to Google Drive (linked in the task), small files can be attached directly
- **Links** → always include all relevant resources (GitHub, Figma, docs, references)
- **Estimate time** → each task must have a time estimate. If you realize the task won’t fit within the estimate, it’s fine — but you must inform the project manager **before** it happens.

  **It is unacceptable to dramatically increase logged hours without informing the PM in advance.**

## ClickUp lifecycle

### Backlog

Ideas, requests, and tasks without clear priority. This is the pool of potential work.  
**Responsibility:** Project Manager / task creator

### To Do

The task is confirmed, prioritized, and ready to start. It has a clear description and is assigned to a team member.  
**Responsibility:** Task owner + assignee

### Pending

The task is on hold — waiting for something external (e.g. client input, missing assets, approval).  
**Responsibility:** Task owner tracks the status and moves it forward when ready

### In Progress

The task is being actively worked on.  
**Responsibility:** Assigned owner

### In Review

The task is finished by the assignee and waiting for review, testing, or approval.  
**Responsibility:** Reviewer (lead dev, PM, designer, depending on task)

### In Testing

The task is under testing or quality assurance to make sure everything works as expected.  
**Responsibility:** assigned reviewer / lead developer

### Ready to Deploy

The task is approved and ready to be pushed to production or staging.  
**Responsibility:** DevOps / lead developer

### Deployed

The task has been successfully deployed and is live.  
**Responsibility:** DevOps / lead developer

### Done

The task has passed review, is approved, is deployed, and is **ready for invoicing**.  
**Responsibility:** Project Manager

### Completed

The task is fully closed and confirmed — by the client or management.  
**Responsibility:** Project Manager

## Friendly reminder

Delivery means clarity.
Nothing is “done” until it’s **tested, approved, and handed off with everything the client needs.**
