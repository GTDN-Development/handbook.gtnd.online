title: "Security"
description: "Legal and security come first — confidentiality, 2FA, and clear rules that protect clients and projects."

## NDA & Confidentiality

- Every team member must sign and respect **NDA agreements**
- Client data, business info, and project details are strictly confidential
- No sharing of client assets outside GTDN without written permission

## GDPR & Data Handling

- Personal data must always be stored and processed in line with **GDPR**
- Use only approved tools for storing client data (Google Workspace, ClickUp, Drive)
- Never store sensitive client data on personal devices without encryption

## Security Rules

- **Passwords** → use company password manager, never share in plain text
- **2FA** → required on all work accounts (Google, GitHub, ClickUp, etc.)
- **Devices** → keep laptops and phones updated and secured with password/biometrics
- **Backups** → important project files and repos must always be backed up

## Intellectual Property

- All work created within GTDN for clients belongs to the client once paid
- Internal projects and frameworks belong to GTDN unless stated otherwise

## Manifesto

Trust is built on responsibility.  
We protect our clients, our work, and our team by keeping security simple, strict, and consistent.
