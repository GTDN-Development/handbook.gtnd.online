## Step 1: Clone Repository

Clone the repository from the link in the navbar (top right corner).

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd docs.gtdn.online
```

## Step 2: Create New Page

all pages are stored in the `content/docs` directory. Navigate to the appropriate folder where you want to add the new page.
for example, to add a new page under the "Handbook/people" section, go to:
```bash
content/docs/handbook/people/my-new-awsome-page.mdx <----- your new page
```
your page structure should look like this:
```bash
---
title: "my new awsome page"
description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
---
this is my new awsome page content.

## Cards

<Cards>
  <Card title="Learn more about GTDN" href="https://GTDN.online" />
</Cards>
```
## Step 3: Creating category
if you need to create a new cattegory, go to:
```bash
content/docs/handbook/my-new-awsome-folder <----- your new folder(category)
```
and create a `meta.json` file inside the folder with the following structure:
```json
{
  "title": "My New Awsome Folder", <--- title of the folder
  "pages": ["my-new-awsome-page"], <---order of pages in this folder
  "defaultOpen": true <--- whether the folder is expanded by default in the sidebar
  "root": false <--- whether this is a root folder
}
```


That's it! Your new page will appear in the sidebar and be accessible via the URL.
