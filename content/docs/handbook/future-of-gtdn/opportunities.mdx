## Why it matters

We grow faster and stronger when everyone brings ideas to the table.  
Innovation doesn’t come only from leadership — it comes from all of us.

## How you can contribute

- **Suggest improvements** → processes, tools, workflows, communication
- **Propose new features** → product ideas, client value, internal projects
- **Share knowledge** → run a short workshop, share an article, record a Loom
- **Spot problems early** → raise blockers, inefficiencies, or risks before they grow
- **Pitch internal projects** → we love developing our own ideas. If you have one, we can dedicate time, focus, and resources to turn it into a star project — together, as partners.

## Channels

- **ClickUp / Notion** → add suggestions or create idea tickets
- **Weekly standup** → raise quick improvement ideas
- **1:1 with PM or leadership** → for deeper discussions

## Manifesto

Contribution is not optional — it’s how we evolve.  
Every voice matters. Every idea counts.  
The best way to shape GTDN is to help build it.
