## How to Make Good Coffee

Because great code deserves great coffee. Here’s the _unofficial GTDN guide_ to making coffee that doesn’t taste like sadness.

## Golden Rules

1. **Beans matter** → freshly roasted and freshly ground. Old coffee = dead coffee.
2. **Water counts** → filtered water, heated to about 92–96 °C (not boiling).
3. **Right ratio** → 1:15 is a good start (1 g coffee per 15 g water).
4. **Timing** → don’t rush it, but don’t overbrew either.
5. **The mug** → the stranger the mug, the better the code.

## Popular Coffee Styles

- **Espresso** → small, strong, pure energy.
- **Americano** → longer, smoother, keeps PMs alive through calls.
- **Flat White** → espresso with silky milk.
- **Latte** → lots of milk, less kick, great for long afternoons.
- **Cappuccino** → balanced foam + milk + espresso = reliable like good documentation.
- **Cold Brew** → patience in a glass, steeped for hours, smooth and strong.

## Brewing Methods

- **Espresso Machine** → fast, powerful, café vibes at home.
- **Moka Pot** → classic Italian style, small but mighty.
- **AeroPress** → digital nomad’s choice: portable, geeky, always good.
- **French Press** → easy, forgiving, perfect for lazy mornings.
- **Pour-over (V60, Chemex)** → slow, precise, almost meditative. Quite fancy.
- **Cold Brew Jar** → just add time (8–12 hours in the fridge).

## Final Touch

- Share coffee in the office → it doubles productivity.
- Show your weird mugs on remote calls → it triples team spirit.

## Manifesto

Life’s too short for bad coffee.  
Better coffee = better code.  
And remember: **more espresso, less depresso.**
