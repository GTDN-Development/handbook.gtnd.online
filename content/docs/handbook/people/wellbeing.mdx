## Why we care

Work is important, but health comes first.  
Strong body + clear mind = better life and better work.

---

## Physical Health

- **Move daily** → walks, sports, or just stretching between tasks
- **Sleep** → aim for 7–8 hours, good sleep beats any hack
- **Eat well** → real food > junk food, stay hydrated
- **Take breaks** → step away from the screen, let your eyes rest
- **Ergonomics** → adjust your chair, desk, and screen for comfort

---

## Mental Health

- **Boundaries** → when you’re off, be really off
- **Talk** → if something bothers you, speak up (1:1 or with the team)
- **Focus** → one task at a time, multitasking drains energy
- **Mindfulness** → walks, meditation, or just 5 min of deep breathing
- **Kindness** → to yourself and to others, mistakes happen and we learn

---

## Simple Rituals

- Short breaks every 90 minutes → stretch, move, breathe
- **Naps are okay** → 20–30 minutes of sleep during the day can multiply your effectiveness
- Share music, memes, or inspiration to lighten the day
- Coffee, tea, or water break = valid meeting with yourself
- Celebrate wins (small and big)

## Manifesto

We’re not machines.  
Take care of your body and mind — it’s the best investment you can make.
