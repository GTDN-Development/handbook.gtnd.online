description: "Time off is simple — communicate early, plan ahead, and take the rest you need without stress."

## General Rules

- Time off must always be **communicated in advance** to the Project Manager
- For longer absences (vacation, sick leave) → inform at least **1 week ahead** if possible
- Short absences (doctor, personal errands) → if possible, inform a few days in advance so planning is easier
- All time off is tracked in shared calendar for visibility

## Availability

- During **core hours (10:00–14:00 CET)** the team should know who is available
- If you are unavailable, always set a short status in chat, calendar or ClickUp

## Sick Days

- Health comes first — take the time you need
- Inform the Project Manager as soon as possible

## Vacations

- Plan vacations in advance so delivery is not impacted
- PM ensures coverage for ongoing tasks and deadlines

## Manifesto

We value results, not hours.  
Time off is part of sustainable work.  
Communicate clearly, plan ahead, and take the rest you need.
