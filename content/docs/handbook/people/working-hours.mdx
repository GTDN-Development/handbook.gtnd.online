title: "Wroking hours and flexibility"
description: "Working hours and flexibility policy: core hours 10–14 CET, results-driven work, and freedom with responsibility."
---


## General Rules

- We focus on **results, not hours** — output matters more than being “always online”
- **Core hours: 10:00–14:00 CET** → everyone must be available and responsive
- Outside core hours → you manage your own time as you see fit

## Flexibility

- Everyone can work according to their own preference, but must define a monthly workload estimate (time range), based on which the PM will plan and assign tasks.
- Work whenever and wherever you are most productive (home, office, café, beach)
- Balance is important → flexibility doesn’t mean being available 24/7
- Communicate availability in advance if you plan to work outside normal patterns

## Meetings & Syncs

- Only one fixed ritual: **Weekly standup on Monday at 11:00 CET**
- Other meetings only if needed and with a clear agenda

## Manifesto

Freedom with responsibility.  
Flexibility is a privilege that works only with trust, clarity, and accountability.
