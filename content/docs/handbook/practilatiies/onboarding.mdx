description: "Onboarding guide: a clear path for new team members to get access, learn processes, and become productive from day one."
---


## Day 1 — Essentials

- Get access to all tools:
  - Google Workspace (email, calendar, Drive, docs, sheets)
  - ClickUp (tasks, time tracking)
  - GitHub (repos, code review)
  - Figma (designs, prototypes)
  - Vercel
- Join internal chat (Google Chat)
- Introduce yourself in the team channel (short note about who you are)

---

## First Week — Learning the Basics

- Read through the **Handbook** (values, communication, task lifecycle)
- Shadow a teammate on a project to see how tasks move from _To Do_ → _Done_
- Have a **1:1 with PM** to set expectations and answer questions
- Set up your working hours / flexibility window for planning
- Check your first tasks (small, low-risk, to learn the flow)

---

## First Month — Getting Productive

- Deliver your first tasks independently
- Join weekly standups and share your updates
- Learn reporting rules (time tracking, invoicing if applicable)
- Give feedback — onboarding is a two-way street, tell us what can be improved
- If you have an idea → share it in **Opportunities to Contribute**

---

## What We Expect

- Be proactive → ask when something is unclear
- Communicate openly → better to ask twice than to deliver wrong
- Track your time → untracked hours can’t be invoiced
- Respect core hours (10:00–14:00 CET)
- Live the values → simplicity, trust, teamwork
