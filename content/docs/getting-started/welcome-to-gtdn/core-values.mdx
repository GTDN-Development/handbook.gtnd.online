---

At GTDN, we believe building great products starts with building the right culture. These values guide how we think, work, and grow – as individuals, as a team, and with our clients.

## Manifesto

We keep things simple, focus on what matters, and trust each other to deliver. We value results over busyness, clarity over noise, and progress over perfection. We’re not here to chase quick wins – we’re here to build meaningful solutions we can be proud of. Together, we grow, we share, and we create lasting impact.

## Principles

### 1. Simplicity wins

We don’t overcomplicate. We always look for the simplest functional solution that delivers the most value for both the client and us. Easy peasy.

### 2. Less, but better

We’d rather do one thing right than three things halfway. A finished, working solution beats endless planning any day.

### 3. Autonomy & trust

Each of us is responsible for our own work and time. No one’s standing over your shoulder – we trust each other and have the freedom to decide. With that comes the responsibility to own the outcome.

### 4. Work isn’t a race

It’s not about sitting 12 hours in front of a screen. What matters are results, not being “busy.” We want to work smart, not just hard. We play long-term games with long-term people.

### 5. Clear communication, no noise

No endless 10-person meetings or bloated processes. We keep it clear, concise, and to the point. Meetings are the last resort. Most things can be solved quickly with a message, a code comment, or a short call. If a meeting happens, it has a clear goal and ends the moment that goal is reached.

### 6. Remote-first mindset

Work isn’t a place – it’s the outcome. Office, café, home, or beach – what matters is code quality, not location.

### 7. Iteration over perfection

We’d rather launch an MVP and refine as we go than wait months for a “perfect” version. Real feedback comes from users. Ship fast, then fine-tune.

### 8. Team over ego

No rockstars here – we’re all in the same boat. We help each other, share knowledge, and grow together.

### 9. Openness & honesty

We don’t deal with issues behind someone’s back. We speak directly – with respect, and with the goal of moving forward. Just like open source, we believe knowledge-sharing and transparency make things better.
